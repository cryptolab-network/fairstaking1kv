# fairstaking1kv

Project Name： Non-profit DElegated Staking Tool (NDeST) 
Short Name： NDeST

## Background
### problem of 1kv project
At present, there are about 158 valid nodes in 1KV（ https://kusama.w3f.community/invalid ）In other words, about 70% of the nodes can not obtain effective income to support the operation of the node. However, we have reason to guess that Web3 should not be able to provide enough staging for all nodes to enter active set, because the smallest staging of KSM must be more than 5000 to be selected successfully. 5000 * 158 is about 790000, which is too large for Web3. Because we think that we need to introduce a new mechanism to solve the problem of insufficient pledge of most nodes in 1KV.
### problem of decentrilization
In the long run, with the increasing value of KSM / dot, institutional pledge may occupy a very important position, and excessive institutional pledge will greatly affect the degree of decentralization of KSM / dot network. Therefore, improving the direct pledge of freeusers to retail investors will be the core to increase the stability of the system.

## Aim 

### Aim of Short Term

It solves the problem that most nodes in 1kV can't get the direct support of Web3, so they can't enter 1kV active set.

### Aim of Long Term
Developing non profit defi based on Kusama, increasing the direct pledge ratio of free users to free validator, and improving the degree of system decentralization should be the core goal of this system

## Relationship with DeFi
### Non-Profit Defi
We can consider creating a new term non profit defi. The traditional defi needs to issue its own token or directly transfer assets and then carry out related financial activities. Non profit defi is also a kind of defi, but it does not aim at transferring assets, but creates a financial instrument with the help of some kind of ecosystem (KSM / dot). The system itself is not profitable. In this project, non profit defi is essentially a pledge tool, in which there is no interest margin. Of course, we can't rule out that in the future, this project may evolve to defi, which may be another project.

### Advantage against DeFi

### 
我们创建Defi，接受来自任何ksm用户的自动委托，通过委托向1kv中的inactive set提供一键质押功能（随机选择任意4个inactive set进行质押），在功能上该质押等同于用户直接选择节点质押，所以在任意时刻用户均可以撤回质押或者再次选择手动质押。

## 意义
通过Defi，解决1kv中流动性不足的问题，通过吸纳自有用户的为1kv增加流动性，提高1kv用户的质押比例。

## 希望的支持

### 国库支持
500ksm
